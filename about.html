    <h1>Cleo Peeples</h1>
    <p>Hello there! My name is Cleo Peeples, and I am a computer science major attending Blue Mountain College.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I play soccer, play video games, and also take time out of my day to get better at coding. I was born in Memphis but completed high school at Olive Branch High School. I was introduced to coding in 8th grade, and ever since then, I've been in love with it. Now, I'm pursuing a degree to learn more about software development. In the future, I aspire to become a software developer and contribute to the IT industry.</p>
